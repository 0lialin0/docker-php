{"name":"Docker-PHP","tagline":"A Docker client in PHP","body":"Docker PHP\r\n==========\r\n\r\n**Docker PHP** (for lack of a better name) is a [Docker](http://docker.com/) client written in PHP. This library is still a work in progress. Not much is supported yet, but the goal is to reach 100% API support.\r\n\r\nThe test suite currently passes against the [Docker Remote API v1.17](http://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.17/).\r\n\r\n[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/docker-php/badge/?version=latest)](http://docker-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) [![Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/stage1/docker-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stage1/docker-php) [![Scrutinizer Code Quality](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/stage1/docker-php/badges/quality-score.png?b=master)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/stage1/docker-php/?branch=master)\r\n\r\nVersioning\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThere is no *stable* version yet and the API is rapidly evolving, but we still try to semantically version the library according to [semver](http://semver.org/), but shifted a little bit:\r\n\r\n* **MAJOR** version number stays to 0 until API freeze\r\n* **MINOR** version number is incremented when a backward incompatible change is made\r\n* **PATCH** version number is incremented when a new feature is added\r\n\r\nSo basically, if you want the `0.5` version set, use a version constraint of `~0.5.0` and you should be fine.\r\n\r\nWe are **NOT** documenting upgrade procedures until we reach a stable API, please read the code and PRs to keep up with what's going on. You can also ask us for help, we're nice people!\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe recommended way to install Docker PHP is of course to use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"stage1/docker-php\": \"@dev\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: there is no stable version of Docker PHP yet.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSee [the documentation](http://docker-php.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\nUnit Tests\r\n----------\r\n\r\nSetup the test suite using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ composer install --dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun it using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bin/phpunit\r\n```\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nHere are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work.\r\n\r\n* You **MUST** follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/).\r\n* You **MUST** run the test suite.\r\n* You **MUST** write (or update) unit tests.\r\n* You **SHOULD** write documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease, write [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before submitting your Pull Request.\r\n\r\nOne may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to \"clean\" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).\r\n\r\nAlso, when creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you **MUST** write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis README heavily inspired by [willdurand/Negotiation](https://github.com/willdurand/Negotiation) by @willdurand.
